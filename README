The Row reordering C++ library -- External memory version
Daniel Lemire

This is a set of row-reordering algorithms and data compression compression schemes implemented in C++. The goal of these algorithms is to maximize the compression ratio of database tables through row reordering.

This library is strictly for researchers with a working knowledge of C++ that are interested in studying our implementation.

For a simple demo (in Java) of the Vortex order described in the paper, please see https://github.com/lemire/SimpleVortex

== Requirements ==

LZO2 library: http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/
Readily available on Linux. Available on macos through fink (for example).

There can be significant differences in compression rate between even minor
revisions of the LZO library. When comparing results, always make sure you have
the exact same version.



The GNU GCC toolchain is obviously required. C++ code should be portable though.

== Usage ==

make tods2011
./tods2011 myfile.csv
