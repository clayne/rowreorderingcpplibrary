The Row reordering C++ library -- External memory version
Daniel Lemire


== Requirements ==

LZO2 library: http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/
Readily available on Linux. Available on macos through fink (for example).

There can be significant differences in compression rate between even minor
revisions of the LZO library. When comparing results, always make sure you have
the exact same version.



The GNU GCC toolchain is obviously required. C++ code should be portable though.

== Usage ==

make tods2011
./tods2011 myfile.csv
