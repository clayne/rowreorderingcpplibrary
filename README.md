# The Row reordering C++ library -- External memory version 

This is a set of row-reordering algorithms and data compression compression schemes implemented in C++. The goal of these algorithms is to maximize the compression ratio of database tables through row reordering.

This library is strictly for researchers with a working knowledge of C++ that are interested in studying our implementation.

For a simple demo (in Java) of the Vortex order described in the paper, please see https://github.com/lemire/SimpleVortex

# Requirements 

A POSIX C/C++ toolchain (linux, macOS)

# Usage
